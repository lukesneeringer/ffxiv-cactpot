## FFXIV Cactpot Solver

This repository contains a simple, straightforward optimization algorithm
for solving the Mini Cactpot game in Final Fantasy XIV.

As brute-forcing expected value for a 3-by-3 grid is not exactly a difficult
problem, this is implemented entirely in JavaScript and deployed as an
entirely "static" website.
